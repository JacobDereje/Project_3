Assumptions:
There has to be a test file that can run those classes because there is not a main method in them.

Bug:
The add method in the LinkedList doesn't work.
The merge method in ArrayList doesn't work, affecting the Sorted test result too.

Contributions:

Jacob - ArrayList, analysis

Brandon - LinkedList, analysis

How to run & compile:

Run the test files instead of running the LinkedList and ArrayList

External sources:
None
